# SRE From Scratch 📖 - A Practical Guide to Building SRE in Any Organization

**SRE From Scratch** is a book designed for **teams and individuals** who want to **implement Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles** but **lack executive buy-in, funding, or top-down initiatives**. This guide provides **practical, no-nonsense strategies** to **bootstrap SRE functions** in any environment—whether you're in a **startup, mid-sized business, or large enterprise** without formal SRE structures.

## 🚀 Why This Book?
Many organizations struggle to **adopt SRE** because:
- There's **no formal SRE team or budget**.
- Engineers are **too busy firefighting incidents** to focus on reliability.
- Leadership **doesn’t see the value in SRE** beyond keeping systems running.
- There’s **no structured roadmap** for implementing SRE principles.

**SRE From Scratch** provides a **step-by-step playbook** for implementing **SLOs, SLIs, observability, automation, and incident response** without waiting for executive approval.
